# Suzuwave Analysis

`Suzuwave` (or `Suzuha Signal Analysis`) is an opensource lightweight analysis tool for various (I hope so) types of signal files. In this environment you've able to perform a set of analysis operations such as

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)
- Short Fourier Transform (SFT)
- Wavelet Transform (WT)
- Filtering
